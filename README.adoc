# Linux Installation Notes

This repository is meant to hold information about Linux installations which I would normally forget cause I don't reinstall my system on a regulary basis.

## Git

### Installation from source

Installation from source is documented on 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git Book] .

### Bash Completion (with checked out sources)

Simply source the bash completion script in the `.bashrc` from the git sources:

 source $GIT_SRC/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash

### Git bash prompt

A really cool bash prompt for git is found under: 
https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt[magic monty]

Configruation:
configuration is done by setting the following environment variables.
To enable the custom theme, copy or link the .git-prompt-colors.sh contained in this repository into your home dir.

* use default settings
* disable
+
`GIT_PROMPT_ONLY_IN_REPO=1`

* configure custom theme:
+
`GIT_PROMPT_THEME=Custom`

## Games

### MTG Arena (Manjaro)

Installation via Lutris is relatively simple, but during installation (after installing .Net) the following error might occur:

 Cannot access URL: https://mtgarena.downloads.wizards.com/Installers/Windows32/0.1.893.0/Live/MTGAInstaller.msi`

This might be caused by a missing (or wrong / outdated version of) TLS library.

Solution might therefore be:

* install an updated version of `gnutls` / `lib32_gnutls`
* install `wine-staging`

## Sharing Keyboard and Mouse between Linux/Windows/MaxOs using barrier

For sharing keyboard and mouse, barrier (which is a fork from synergy) does a very good job.

### Install on Manjaro
For Manjaro, it can be easily installed via aur (package name is barrier).

### Compile / Install on CentOS

As there is no rpm in the official repositories, one way of installing barrier is to compile
it by hand. For compiling barrier, avahi-compat-libdns_sd might be missing.
Dragging and Dropping in the server configuration windows does not seem to work at the moment.

 # fetch sources from github
 git clone https://github.com/debauchee/barrier.git

 #compile barrier
 ./clean_bui.d.sh

#### install missing avahi dependency
 yum install avahi-compat-libdns_sd-devel.x86_64
