# Linux Installation Notes

This repository is meant to hold information about Linux installations which I would normally forget cause I don't reinstall my system on a regulary basis.

# Git

## Installation from source

Installation from source is documented on 
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[Git Book] .

## Bash Completion (with checked out sources)

Simply source the bash completion script in the `.bashrc` from the git sources:

 source $GIT_SRC/git/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
